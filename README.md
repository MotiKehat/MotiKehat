- 👋 Hi, I’m @MotiKehat of Himmelfarb High School's FRC team 8BIT 7845 in Jerusalem, Israel.
- 👀 I’m interested in FRC programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the WPILib software packages.
- 💞️ I’m not yet ready to collaborate.
- 📫 You can reach me any of several ways.
- 😄 Pronouns: he = הוא, him = אותו. (In Hebrew, as in French, nouns too are male, female or a few both.) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Jerusalem is not much further from the Western border of China than Beijing is.
